        <p>A Summary</p>
        <p>
            Urban pollution is the introduction of harmful substances and forms of energy—like chemicals, noise, light, and heat—into city environments, negatively affecting ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. Urban pollution in waterways is mainly caused by stormwater runoff that picks up contaminants from cities and transports them into rivers, lakes, and coastal areas. Aside from plastic debris and sediment, common pollutants typically include heavy metals, oil, chemicals, nutrients, pathogens, and household wastes.

            <p>Urban Pollution in NZ</p>
            <p>
                Urban pollution in New Zealand is a growing environmental and public health issue, particularly in large urban centres like Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington, Hamilton, and Dunedin. It includes a combination of air, water, noise, light, and soil pollution, often driven by transport, construction, industrial activity, and stormwater runoff.

            <p>Sources of Urban Pollution</p>
            <p>
                Urban Pollution can be the caused by many things aside from stormwater runoff, such as industrial spills and discharges, agriculture, and leaking seweage systems. Faecal contamination remains the most widespread water quality issue, impacting urban waterway health and posing risks to human and ecological health

        <p>Consequences of Urban Pollution on NZ's waterways</p>
        <p>
            Urban waterways often have poorer water quality than rural ones, with higher levels of pathogens, sediments, and heavy metals like zinc and copper. These pollutants cause eutrophication, algal blooms, oxygen depletion, fish kills, and loss of aquatic biodiversity. They also pose human health risks through contaminated drinking water and recreational exposure to pathogens.
