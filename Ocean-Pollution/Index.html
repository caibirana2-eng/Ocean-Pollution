            <p>A Summary</p>
            <p>
                As of 2025, New Zealand's marine environment faces (and has been facing since the late 20th century) an ever-increasing pressure from pollution. While some areas are relatively clean, pollution is more concentrated near urban centers and areas with intensive agriculture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Human activities on land, like industrial and agricultural runoff, contribute to the problem, with plastic being the most prevalent type of litter found on beaches.
            </p>
            <p>
                Microplastics, which result from the breakdown of larger plastics, are also widespread and can impact marine life and potentially human health.

            <p>Consequences of Ocean Pollution</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Harm to marine life:
                    Plastic and other pollutants can entangle, injure, or kill marine animals and seabirds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Impact on food chains:
                    Microplastics and pollutants can accumulate in marine organisms, potentially affecting those higher up the food chain, including humans.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Impact on human health:
                    Microplastics and chemicals in the marine environment can pose risks to human health through the consumption of seafood.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Impact on recreation and cultural practices:
                    Pollution can impact recreational activities like swimming and fishing, and affect the ability to harvest seafood.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Damage to marine ecosystems:
                    Pollution can affect water quality, leading to harmful algal blooms which can impact habitats like shellfish beds and coral.
                </li>

            <p>3 Types of Pollution Affecting our Oceans</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Plastic Pollution:
                   A highly visible and pervasive form of ocean pollution. It encompasses a wide range of plastic items, from large debris like bottles and bags to tiny microplastics, which are fragments less than 5mm in size. These plastics accumulate in the ocean, harming marine life through entanglement, ingestion, and habitat destruction. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sediment pollution:
                    Occurs when excessive amounts of soil, sand, and other particulate matter are carried into waterways. This can happen naturally through erosion, but human activities like construction, agriculture, and deforestation significantly accelerate the process. Sediment pollution negatively impacts water quality, aquatic life, and human health. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Urban Pollution:
                    Urban areas, particularly coastal cities, act as major entry points for runoff pollutants, which are carried to the ocean via rivers and stormwater systems.
